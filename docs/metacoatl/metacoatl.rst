Metacoatl
---------

Metacoatl is a place to showcase work flows enabled by mixcoatl. 

Through creating mixing of the :ref:`core DCM Utilities <dcm_utilities>` some
useful and time saving opportunities arise. 

The purpose of the metacoatl section is to seed ideas that will lead to your
own mixcoatl work flows.
